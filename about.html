            <h1>About <span>Me</span></h1>
            <h3>Hello! My name is Aleksandra Arykova</h3>
            <p>I'm 19 years old, and I'm from Kyrgyzstan, currently residing in Bishkek. I am currently a first-year student at Ala-Too International University, where I am studying Computer Engineering. My main goal is to become a <span class="red">Full-stack </span> developer.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about the world of programming and creating web applications. My interest in this field began long ago when I first saw the amazing opportunities that open up to those who possess development skills. Now I am diligently learning and practicing, striving for excellence in creating efficient and innovative software.</p>
            <p>In addition to my studies, I also pay attention to learning foreign languages. I am fluent in Russian, Kyrgyz, English, Turkish, and German. I am particularly interested in improving my German language skills as I dream of visiting Germany and immersing myself in its culture, as well as participating in international IT projects and exchanges of experience.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I often engage in self-education, studying new technologies and programming principles. I participate in online courses, read professional literature, and work on my own projects to apply the knowledge I have gained in practice.</p>
            <p>I am fascinated to see how technology is changing our world, and I want to be a part of this progress. My goals are not just to become a good developer, but also to create solutions that will improve people's lives and make the world a better place.</p>
